#  Dodgers And Diamondbacks To Play In Slot Machine Tournament

In a matchup that will surely excite fans, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks are set to play in a slot machine tournament at the Casino Del Sol in Tucson, Arizona.

The event, which is scheduled for Thursday evening, will be hosted by Diamondbacks infielder Deven Marrero. Marrero is a known casino enthusiast and said he’s excited to put on the event.

“I love playing slots, so I thought it would be a lot of fun to do this tournament with the Dodgers,” Marrero said. “It should be a pretty good battle between the two teams.”

The tournament will feature eight players from each team, four from the active roster and four from the bench. They will compete in a single-elimination format with the losers being eliminated after each round. The final two players will then square off in a best-of-three series to determine the champion.

The prize for winning? A cool $10,000.

Both teams appear evenly matched, but there are a few players who could make a big impact in the tournament. Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager is always dangerous at the plate and has plenty of experience playing in casinos. Diamondbacks outfielder David Peralta is also a threat, as he’s coming off of a season where he hit .293 with 27 homers and 85 RBIs.

It should be an exciting event and one that fans won’t want to miss.
