#  What do they offer their customers?

Dollar Shave Club is a company that offers razors and other shaving supplies to their customers for a monthly fee. This company was started in 2011 by Michael Dubin and his friends who were looking for a more affordable way to get their razors. The company has exploded in popularity in recent years, and now boasts over 3 million members.

One of the things that makes Dollar Shave Club stand out from other companies is the sense of humor that Dubin brings to the advertising. In one popular commercial, he starts by saying “Our blades are f***ing great” and goes on to list all of the reasons why DSC is better than traditional razor companies. This approach has helped Dollar Shave Club build a large following online, as well as through word-of-mouth referrals.

In addition to razors, Dollar Shave Club also offers other shaving supplies such as shave cream, body wash, and after-shave balm. These products are all high quality and priced competitively when compared to similar products from other brands.

# Why do people love it?

The second reason is the convenience. With DSC, you can have all of your shaving supplies delivered right to your door each month without having to go shopping for them yourself. And finally, the sense of humor that Dubin brings to the advertising makes people feel like they are part of a club – something special that not everyone gets to be a part of.
