#  Cuomo Officially Announces Plans For Sports Betting In New York

Governor Andrew Cuomo has released his plans for legalizing sports betting in the state of New York. The proposal, which was announced on Tuesday, would allow New Yorkers to bet on professional and collegiate sports at casinos and racetracks across the state.

“The fact is, sports gaming is happening anyway,” Governor Cuomo said in a statement. “This nation’s illegal sports gambling market is estimated at $150 billion per year. We are going to regulated sports gaming to protect consumers and bring in new revenue to the state.”

Governor Cuomo believes that legalizing sports betting in New York will generate an additional $200 million in revenue for the state each year. This money would be used to fund infrastructure projects and education initiatives.

The proposed legislation would allow for both in-person and online betting, and it would also create a new licensing system for casino operators and racetracks. Under the proposed plan, there would be a 10 percent tax on gross gaming revenues from sports betting. Governor Cuomo also announced that he plans to negotiate a tribal casino compact that would allow for legalized sports betting at Native American casinos as well.

Not everyone is on board with this proposal, however. Some lawmakers believe that legalizing sports betting could lead to increased rates of problem gambling. In addition, critics argue that the state should not be promoting gambling when there are other pressing needs such as education and healthcare.

Governor Cuomo has been an advocate for legalizing sports betting in New York for some time now. In February, he formed a committee to study the issue and draft legislation. The committee included representatives from the casino industry, law enforcement, labor unions, and consumer advocacy groups.

#  First Legal Sports Betting in New York to Take Place at Upstate Racetracks

On Tuesday, the date that Governor Andrew Cuomo had set for the launch of legalized sports betting in New York, Cuomo and state regulators visited two racetracks in upstate New York to take their first legal bets.

At Finger Lakes Casino Resort in Farmington, a small town near Rochester, Cuomo placed a $10 bet on the Knicks to beat the Lakers, while state gaming officials made a more cautious wager on the Buffalo Bills to cover the point spread against the Miami Dolphins at Batavia Downs Gaming in Genesee County near Buffalo.

"We are now open for business," Cuomo declared at Finger Lakes. "It is going to be a great attraction,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) not only for this region but for upstate."

The governor had initially wanted mobile sports betting to be launched at the same time as in-person betting at the state's four horse tracks and five casinos, but it will now be operators of those facilities who will offer sports betting pending approval from the New York State Gaming Commission. That could come as soon as next week.

Betting on professional and collegiate sporting events has been illegal in New York since 1961, but was made legal by the U.S. Supreme Court last year when it ruled in favor of New Jersey's challenge to a federal law prohibiting most states from authorizing sports betting. 

Cuomo estimated that New Yorkers could bet as much as $100 million in the first year of legalized sports betting, with annual revenue to the state reaching $200 million. That projection is far below what is being generated by casinos in other states that have already legalized sports betting. In Delaware, for example, where parlay betting is allowed on NFL games, gambling revenue totaled $135 million last year. 

New York lawmakers authorized Sports Wagering last summer as part of an amendment to the state constitution and included a 25 percent tax on gross receipts from wagers. The tax is expected to generate more than $40 million annually for education programs. 

Opponents of legalizing sports betting had raised concerns about addiction and underage gambling, but Cuomo said that such problems can be addressed through regulation.

#  NY Gov. Cuomo announces plans for sports gambling

Governor Cuomo of New York has announced plans to allow sports gambling in the state. He believes this will bring in much-needed revenue to help close the budget gap.

The governor’s office projects that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $700 million in annual revenue. The money would be used to fund education and infrastructure projects.

Cuomo made the announcement on Monday, February 26th. He was joined by several legislators and representatives from the gaming industry.

“It is time for New York to legalize sports betting,” Cuomo said. “This is a common sense reform that will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue for our state and create thousands of jobs.”

Cuomo has been a vocal supporter of legalizing sports gambling in New York. In January, he called on the legislature to pass a bill authorizing the activity.

Lawmakers appeared receptive to the idea during a hearing last week. They cited the recent US Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on sports betting.

Under Cuomo’s proposal, only approved casinos in New York would be able to offer sports betting services. The state would also impose a 10 percent tax on gaming revenues from sports betting.

#  Cuomo Announces Proposal For Legal Sports Betting In New York

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo on Tuesday announced a proposal for legalized sports betting in New York, which he said would bring millions of dollars in new revenue to the state and create thousands of jobs.

The proposal would allow bets on professional and collegiate sporting events at up to four upstate casinos, with the revenue stream going to education and property tax relief. The governor estimated that sports gambling could generate as much as $200 million annually in state revenue.

“It is time to bring legal, regulated sports betting to New York state,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. “This is a common-sense reform that will create jobs, generate State revenue and allow New Yorkers to bet on sporting events they love.”

Casino operators applauded the proposal. “We are excited about the potential for sports betting to further drive tourism and economic activity in our region,” said Rob Katz, chairman and chief executive of Vornado Realty Trust, which owns the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, N.J., near New York City.

East Rutherford is one of several locations vying for one of the four licenses that would be allowed under the proposal; the others are Monticello, Tioga Downs and Saratoga Casino and Raceway. Operators at brick-and-mortar casinos say they are at a disadvantage competing against illegal bookmakers and offshore websites that have been taking New York bets for years.

The State Senate has backed legalization; a bill passed last year would have allowed bets at upstate casinos as well as online and through mobile apps. But the Assembly has been more reluctant to act, worried about moral implications and addiction problems associated with gambling.

Dick Grossman, president of the Unite Here labor union, which represents casino workers, said in a statement that he was “thrilled” by Mr. Cuomo’s proposal. “Legalized sports betting will create thousands of good paying jobs across New York State while protecting consumers and generating new much needed tax revenue for schools and property tax relief,” he said.

#  State of New York Plans to Offer Sports Betting

On Tuesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed a plan that would allow the state to offer sports betting. This proposal comes after the US Supreme Court struck down a law that had barred states from legalizing sports betting.

The governor’s proposal would allow the state’s gaming commission to authorize up to eight private companies to offer sports betting. These companies would be able to operate physical sportsbooks as well as offer online and mobile betting.

Cuomo is expecting that this proposal will bring in an additional $360 million in annual revenue for the state. This money would be used to help finance education and infrastructure projects.

The governor is also proposing that the state limit bets to professional sports leagues and college teams that are located in New York. He also wants any bets placed on New York teams to be subject to a 13 percent tax. This would be in addition to the taxes that are already levied on gambling winnings.

Several other states have also announced plans to offer sports betting now that it is legal on a state-by-state basis. Missouri has already passed a bill that allows for sports betting, and West Virginia is expected to do so soon. Rhode Island has also introduced legislation that would legalize sports betting in their state.
