#  $1,000 or Less Won't Be Taxed at All!

A recent change in the tax code means that people with income of $1,000 or less will not have to pay taxes. This change is intended to help low-income people, who are often hit hardest by taxes.

This change is good news for people who are struggling financially. It means that they will have a little more money to live on each month. It also means that they will be able to keep more of their hard-earned money.

This change is also good news for the economy. Low-income people are more likely to spend their money than save it. This will help to boost the economy and create jobs.

Thank you, Congress, for passing this important change!

#  Gambling Winnings of Up to $5,000 a Year Will Not be Taxed

The government has announced that gambling winnings of up to $5,000 a year will not be taxed from 1 July 2019.

This change means that the majority of people who win small amounts of money from gambling will no longer need to report or pay tax on those winnings.

Assistant Treasurer Stuart Robert said: " This reform will simplified the tax system for gambling winnings and make it fairer for all Australians. It builds on our already world-leading taxation arrangements for gambling.

" Most people who gamble won't be affected by this change, but those who do win more than $5,000 can continue to have that amount taxed at their marginal tax rate."

#  More Than $5,000 in Gambling Winnings Will be Taxed at 28%

When you win money from gambling - whether it's casino games, the lottery, or betting on sports - your income is taxable. And the amount of tax you'll have to pay will depend on how much money you won.

If you won more than $5,000 in a single day, your gambling winnings will be taxed at 28%. This is the highest rate of tax, and it will apply to any amount over $5,000.

But if you only won a small amount of money - $600 or less - then you won't have to pay any taxes on your winnings. This is because the IRS considers gambling winnings to be "tax-free" income up to this amount.

So if you're lucky enough to hit the jackpot at the casino, or score a big victory betting on your favorite sports team, be prepared to pay some taxes on your winnings. The good news is that if you only won a small amount, you don't need to worry about it.

#  Get Ready to Pay Taxes on All Your Gambling Winnings!

In the United States, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. This means that you are required to report all of your gambling winnings on your annual tax return. The good news is that you can also claim any gambling losses as a deduction on your tax return.

If you have won a substantial amount of money from gambling, you will likely need to pay a good amount of taxes on those winnings. The amount of tax you owe will depend on your total taxable income for the year. However, in most cases, gambling winnings are taxed at the same rate as regular income.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, if you win a large amount of money from playing the lottery, your winnings may be subject to a different tax rate. In addition, some types of gambling income may be excluded from taxation altogether. If you have any questions about how to report your gambling income, be sure to speak with a qualified tax professional.

Despite the fact that gambling income is taxable, many people do not report their winnings on their tax returns. This can lead to trouble with the IRS, and can even result in fines and penalties. If you have won money from gambling and failed to report it on your return, it is important to come clean and amend your return as soon as possible.

The IRS takes taxation of gambling income seriously, and you should too! Be sure to report all of your gambling wins and losses on your tax return so that you can avoid any unwanted hassle with the IRS.

#  Non-Resident Gamblers Required to Pay 45% Tax on Winnings

The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) just announced that it will start imposing a 45% tax on the winnings of non-resident casino players effective January 1, 2019.

In a statement, PAGCOR said that the new policy is in line with the government’s goal of generating more revenue from the gaming industry.

“This measure is aimed at maximizing the collection of taxes from non-resident casino players and in accordance with the directive of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to further increase government revenues,” PAGCOR said.

Under the new policy, non-resident casino players will be required to pay a 45% tax on their winnings. This means that if you win PHP 100,000 in a casino, you will have to pay PHP 45,000 in taxes.

PAGCOR also clarified that this tax applies only to non-resident casino players, and not to Filipinos or residents of other countries.

The news has generated mixed reactions among casino players. Some are happy about the new policy because it will help them avoid paying high taxes on their winnings. Others are unhappy because they think it will make casinos less profitable and could lead to job losses.

What do you think about PAGCOR’s new policy?
