#  What is esports toto?

Known as esports or electronic sports, competitive video gaming has been around for over three decades. Tournaments have been held with games such as Space Invaders, Pong, and Super Mario Bros., but it’s only been in the last ten years that the industry has started to take off. Prize pools are now in the millions of dollars and viewership is in the hundreds of millions. So what is esports?

Simply put, esports is a form of competitive video gaming where players pit their skills against each other in a tournament setting. While the games may differ, the format is largely the same. There are usually either solo or team-based competitions where contestants battle it out in a best-of-three or best-of-five series to see who comes out on top. The players can be from anywhere in the world and compete online or in person.

What makes esports so unique is that it’s a mix of both digital and physical worlds. Players can control their characters on a screen like they would in any other video game, but they’re also playing against someone else face to face. This gives esport tournaments a more personal feel as spectators can watch players interact with one another and see all the strategic plays unfold.

While there are some minor differences, most popular esport titles follow a very similar formula: two teams of five players each competing against each other to achieve certain goals. The two most popular genres are first-person shooters (Battlefield, Counter-Strike) and MOBAs (Dota 2, League of Legends). In first-person shooters, teams compete by trying to kill each other or complete objectives such as capturing points; while MOBAs pit two teams of five players against each other in an arena where they must destroy the enemy's base.

The current king of esports is undoubtedly Riot Games’ League of Legends. With an annual prize pool of over $5 million and viewership that regularly surpasses 100 million people, it’s clear that LoL is one of the most popular games in the world right now. Other big hitters in terms of prize money include Valve’s Dota 2 with over $20 million given out annually and Blizzard’s Overwatch with just over $6 million. These numbers are only going to continue to grow as esport becomes more mainstream and more sponsors enter into the market.
