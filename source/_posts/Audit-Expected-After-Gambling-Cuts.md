#  Audit Expected After Gambling Cuts

The state of New Jersey is planning to reduce its spending on gambling, which is likely to have an impact on the gaming industry. The government has not released any information on the details of the cuts, but it is expected that there will be an audit of the industry in light of the proposed changes.

According to analysts, the gaming industry in New Jersey is worth around $2.5 billion. The state is planning to reduce its spending by around $300 million, which is likely to have a significant impact on the industry. It is unclear how the government plans to make these cuts, but it is expected that there will be an audit of the industry in order to assess the impact.

Governor Chris Christie has been a vocal supporter of gambling reform in New Jersey and he believes that the state should focus on reducing its reliance on casinos. In December last year, he announced plans to reduce the amount of money that the state spends on gambling, and it is now clear that this will have a significant impact on the gaming industry.

It is expected that there will be an audit of all aspects of the gaming industry in New Jersey, from casino operators to suppliers and vendors. The government wants to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the proposed changes and that they are able to adapt accordingly.

The gambling cuts are part of a wider effort by Governor Christie to reduce public spending in New Jersey. He recently announced plans to reduce pension payments and health benefits for state employees, as well as raising taxes. These measures are designed to help close the budget deficit in New Jersey, which currently stands at $1.6 billion.

#  Casino's React to Pennsylvania Gambling Cuts

Casinos in Pennsylvania are fighting back against the state government after it cut their gambling revenue by $200 million.

The government cites an overabundance of casinos as the reason for the cuts, but casino operators say that the cuts are unfair and will lead to job losses.

Executives from several of the state's casinos went to Harrisburg on Wednesday to meet with lawmakers and plead their case.

"We're not asking for a handout," said Gavin Isaacs, CEO of Mount Airy Casino Resort. "We're simply asking that our industry be treated fairly."

Lawmakers were sympathetic, but said that there was little they could do given the state's budget shortfall.

"I feel for you, I really do," said Representative Gene DiGirolamo. "But I can't vote for a tax increase."

The casinos aren't giving up though. They've hired a lobbying firm and are planning a publicity campaign to try and win over legislators and the public.

#  PA Lottery Responds to Gambling Cutbacks

In the wake of Pennsylvania’s new budget that is set to take effect on July 1, the PA Lottery has announced a plan to reduce costs. This plan includes laying off more than 100 employees, as well as ceasing the printing of tickets that are not currently being sold.

The PA Lottery is a $3.5-billion enterprise, and it is anticipated that these cost-cutting measures will save the organization around $50 million annually. In addition to layoffs and ticket cessation, other changes include reducing the number of promotional materials and scaling back on customer service hours.

This news comes as a bit of a surprise to many in light of Pennsylvania’s recent decision to expand gambling opportunities in the state. Just a few weeks ago, lawmakers passed a bill that would allow for new casinos to be built, as well as for online gambling to be legalized.

It was believed that this legislation would bring in much-needed revenue for the state; however, it now appears that the PA Lottery is doing what it can to make up for lost funds. Larry Bradley, spokesperson for the lottery, stated: 

"The lottery's mandate is unchanged. We are responsible for generating revenue for programs authorized by the legislature, and we will continue to do so."

So far, there has been no word on how these layoffs and cost reductions will impact customers or retailers who sell lottery tickets.

#  Gambling Reduction Leads to Audit

The reduction in gambling revenue has led the state government to order an audit of the two casinos.

Casino Audit
The state government has ordered an audit of the casino operations after the reduction in gambling revenue. The two casinos, which are operated by the Native American tribe, have been struggling since the state legalized gambling in 2013. The state received 25% of the gambling revenue, which was used to fund education and other programs. The audit will determine how much money the state has lost due to the legalization of gambling.

The Native American tribe has been lobbying for the repeal of the state’s gambling law, but it is unlikely that the legislature will take action. The tribe has already threatened to file a lawsuit if the law is not repealed.

#  State Auditors Examining Gambling Industry After Budget Cuts

The state auditors are examining the gambling industry after budget cuts. The goal is to find ways to save money.

There are two options under consideration: closing some casinos or reducing the number of machines in each casino.

The governor is in favor of closing some casinos. But the Senate president says that will cost jobs and reduce state revenue.

Reducing the number of machines would save money, but it could also lead to job losses.

The gambling industry is a major source of revenue for the state. It's not clear how much money the state could save by closing casinos or reducing the number of machines.
