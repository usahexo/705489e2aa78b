#  How to get a $100 online casino referral bonus!

If you’re looking for a new online casino to play at, why not get a referral bonus just for signing up? Many casinos offer bonuses for signing up through a friend or affiliate, and the best ones are worth $100 or more.

Here’s how to get a $100 online casino referral bonus:

2. Sign up using a friend’s referral link. Once you’ve chosen a casino, sign up through your friend’s referral link. This is the link they will give you once they’ve registered with the casino themselves.

3. Claim your bonus! Once you’ve registered and deposited some money, the casino will credit your account with the referral bonus. Make sure to read the terms and conditions so you know exactly what to expect.

That’s it! By following these simple steps, you can claim a $100 online casino referral bonus in no time. So what are you waiting for?

Getting a referral bonus at an online casino is a great way to score some extra cash, and it’s not too difficult to do. All you need is a friend who is already playing at the casino and you’re good to go.

If you don’t have any friends playing at the online casino yet, don’t worry – there are plenty of ways to find them. Casinos often have social media pages where they promote their latest bonuses and offer free spins to new players. You can also search for online casino reviews, where you can find lists of the best bonuses offered by different casinos.

Once you have found a casino that you want to play at, the next step is to create an account. This process is usually very simple, and all you need is your name, email address, and date of birth. You will also be asked to choose a username and password.

Once your account is created, your next step is to make a deposit. Most casinos accept payments via credit or debit card, as well as through e-wallets like PayPal and Skrill. The minimum deposit amount usually varies from £10-£20 depending on the casino.

Once your deposit has been made, your next step is to contact your friend and let them know that you have joined the casino. They will then need to open an account of their own and make a deposit. Once both of you have deposited funds into your accounts, the casino will credit your account with a bonus equal to 20% of your friend’s deposited amount up to £100!

There are a few things worth knowing before you start playing at an online casino though. Firstly, always check the wagering requirements attached to any bonus that you receive – this will tell you how many times you need to play through the bonus amount before it can be withdrawn. Secondly, always make sure that you are aware of the maximum bet limits – most casinos will limit how much you can bet per spin or per day when using a bonus. Finally, always remember to gamble responsibly and never spend more than you can afford to lose!
