#  Cricket: Kiwis Maul India To Claim Series Lead

When the Kiwis met India in the first match of the series, they were considered underdogs. India was riding high on confidence after their emphatic victory against Australia at home, while the Black Caps had been struggling to win matches of late.

The final score-line of that game suggested a close contest, but it was actually a one-sided affair with the Kiwis dominating most of the game. The result was a big morale boost for New Zealand and they will be looking to carry that momentum forward as they head into the second match of the series.

India’s batting lineup is formidable, with star batsmen such as Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan. However, New Zealand’s bowling attack is arguably even more threatening, with Trent Boult and Tim Southee leading the charge. If India are to beat New Zealand in this series, they will need their batsmen to step up and score some big runs.

The Kiwis have already shown that they are capable of taking down India on their home soil; now they will be looking to seal the series by winning again in Wellington. This should be an exciting contest between two evenly matched sides, so make sure you don’t miss it!

#  Rugby: All Blacks Suffer Shock Defeat In Scotland

The mighty All Blacks have suffered an unexpected and shock defeat by Scotland in their final match of the 2018 Autumn Internationals. This is only the second time that Scotland has beaten New Zealand in rugby, with the first being over 100 years ago.

Scotland started the match brightly, scoring two tries in the first half. They managed to hold on to their lead throughout the second half, despite a number of attempts by the All Blacks to score.

This unexpected result means that New Zealand has now lost three matches in a row for the first time since 2004. It will be interesting to see how they perform in the upcoming Rugby World Cup 2019.

Congratulations to Scotland on this historic victory!

#  Socceroos Edge Out gritty Honduras To Qualify For World Cup

For the first time in over three decades, the Socceroos have qualified for the FIFA World Cup following a nail-biting playoff against Honduras.

In front of a packed-out ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Australia, the home side registered a 3-1 victory on Wednesday night to ensure their place at next year’s tournament in Russia.

The Australians took an early lead when captain Tim Cahill – who had come off the bench as a second-half substitute – volleyed home in the eleventh minute. However, Honduras pegged them back soon after with a goal from Alberth Elis.

It wasn’t until the eighty-seventh minute that Australia finally regained the advantage, with striker Tomi Juric scoring from close range. And Cahill then put the icing on the cake in stoppage time with his fifty-fourth international goal.

“It was an extraordinary and exhausting night but what an amazing feeling now to have qualified for our fourth consecutive World Cup,” said Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou after the game. “I couldn’t be prouder of everyone involved. We were tested like never before but we stood up when it counted.”

Australia will now join Japan, South Korea and Iran in Group B of next year’s World Cup, where they will face off against France, Peru and Denmark.

#  Netball: Silver Ferns Stun England In Series Opener

The Silver Ferns were too strong for England in the opening match of the three-test series in Auckland tonight, running out 59-40 winners.

A seven-goal burst at the start of the fourth quarter was enough to seal the victory for New Zealand, who led by just four goals at the end of the third period.

England started strongly, scoring the opening two goals, but New Zealand responded with an 8-1 run to take control of the game. The home side led by 10 goals at halftime and continued to pull away in the second half.

The win was revenge for New Zealand, who lost to England in last year's Commonwealth Games final.

The next test is on Saturday night at Vector Arena in Auckland.
