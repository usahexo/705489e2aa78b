#  Blackhawk Internet Casino Joins Forces with Evolution Gaming

Last month, Blackhawk Internet Casino announced that it had reached an agreement with Evolution Gaming to supply the site with live dealer games. The move is seen as a major coup by Evolution, who now has its products featured on one of the largest and most popular online casinos in the United States.

The agreement between Blackhawk and Evolution will see the supply of a range of live dealer games, including blackjack, roulette, baccarat and casino Hold’em. Players at the casino will have access to games broadcast from Evolution’s studios in Latvia and Malta. Commenting on the new agreement, Evolution CEO Jens Wilhelmsson said: “Blackhawk is rightly respected as one of the most successful iGaming operators in the world, so we are absolutely delighted that they have chosen Evolution as their partner for live casino gaming.”

Blackhawk Internet Casino is part of the Isle of Man-based Amaya Gaming Group, which operates a number of other online casinos including PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker. The company has over 1.2 million registered players and generated revenues of over $520 million in 2017. Commenting on the deal, Amaya Gaming Group CEO Rafi Ashkenazi said: “We are excited to be partnering with Evolution Gaming – a world-leading supplier of live casino products – to bring our players an unrivaled live casino experience.”

For Evolution Gaming, the deal with Blackhawk is another major coup after agreements signed earlier this year with Caesars Entertainment Corporation and MGM Resorts International. The company is quickly emerging as the go-to supplier for live dealer games for some of the biggest names in iGaming.
