#  Blackjack II purchase sparks Amis outage

#

In a bizarre turn of events, the purchase of a Blackjack II handheld gaming system has caused an outage for Amis users.

The Blackjack II is advertised as being able to play games, browse the internet and check email. However, it seems that the device was not meant for the public as it has caused widespread issues for Amis users.

Reports of people being unable to access the internet, send or receive emails or even just surf the web have been flooding in since the purchase of the Blackjack II. In fact, some users have even taken to social media to vent their frustration at the issue.

One Twitter user, @AmisOutage, has even set up a dedicated account to track the latest news on the outage. The account has been tweeting updates since 8am this morning and it currently has over 1,700 followers.

Despite numerous complaints from Amis users, there is still no word from the company on what is causing the outage or when it will be resolved.

However, we will keep you updated on any new developments as they happen.

#  Blackjack II sale at Amis confounds experts

The recent Blackjack II sale at Amis confounds experts. While some attribute the high sales to the nostalgia factor, others believe that Blackjack II’s new features drew customers in.

Released in 2009, Blackjack II was a successor to the popular Blackjack phone. The phone featured a 3.2 inch touchscreen and 5 megapixel camera. It also included a number of other features, such as face unlock and a magnetic sensor.

In anticipation of the release of the iPhone 4S, Blackjack II’s price was discounted from $499 to $399 in October 2011. In March 2012, its price was further discounted to $299 ahead of the release of the iPhone 5. In September 2013, its price was lowered to $199 in preparation for the release of the iPhone 6. And finally, on April 1, 2017, its price was dropped to just $99 as part of an April Fool’s Day joke by Amis.

The Blackjack II’s low price tag and its new features may have contributed to its high sales numbers.

#  Amis customers left in the dark after Blackjack II purchase

Amis, a Malta-based telecommunications company, is in the hot seat after customers complained about not receiving the Blackjack II phone they purchased.

On December 1st, 2017, Amis sent out a tweet announcing the sale of the Blackjack II. The phone was set to become available on December 11th, but customers are still waiting for their orders to be delivered.

Frustration is mounting among customers who have taken to social media to express their dissatisfaction with the company.

One customer tweeted, "@AmisMalta ordered my blackjack 2 on the 1st and still no shipping confirmation or product. What's going on?"

Another customer complained, "Hey @amismalta where is my Blackjack 2 order? I've been waiting over two weeks now."

In an email statement to Lovin Malta, an Amis spokesperson said: "We would like to let our customers know that we are aware of the delay in shipping certain Blackjack II orders and apologize for any inconvenience caused. We would also like to assure customers that their orders will be processed and shipped as soon as possible."

The spokesperson did not provide a specific date for when the orders would be shipped.

Lovin Malta reached out to some of the customers who purchased the Blackjack II phone, but all declined to comment due to pending litigation against Amis.
