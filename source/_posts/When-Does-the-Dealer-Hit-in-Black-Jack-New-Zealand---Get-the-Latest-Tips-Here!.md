#  When Does the Dealer Hit in Black Jack New Zealand - Get the Latest Tips Here!

In blackjack, the dealer hit is when the dealer takes another card from the deck to try and improve their hand. This can either be good news or bad news for players, as it can mean they’re closer to busting or getting closer to 21. So when does the dealer hit in blackjack?

The answer to this question isn’t always clear cut, as it depends on a number of factors such as the casino rules and the dealer’s own cards. However, in general, the dealer hit rule is that they will take another card if their total is 16 or under. This means that they will stand if their total is 17 or over.

Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, and the dealer may choose to hit even if their total is 16 or under. For example, some casinos may choose to have a ‘soft 17’ rule, which means that the dealer will hit on any hand with a total of 17 (including those with an Ace). So it’s important for players to be aware of any particular house rules that apply at each casino.

In addition, dealers will also often adjust their hitting strategy depending on the player’s own cards. For example, if a player has a weak hand (e.g. 5-6), the dealer may choose to hit even if their total is already 16 or under. Conversely, if a player has a strong hand (e.g. Ace-King), the dealer may choose not to hit even if their total is only 16.

So as you can see, there are many different factors that determine whether or not the dealer will hit in blackjack. But by understanding the basic rules and how they vary from casino to casino, players can put themselves in a much better position to make winning decisions at the table!

#  When to Hit or Stand in Black Jack - Dealer Hits at 17 in New Zealand Casinos

In order to win in blackjack, you need to make the best decision possible on each hand. This means knowing when to hit and when to stand.

When you are playing in a casino in New Zealand, the dealer will hit on a soft 17. This means that if the dealer has a hand with an ace and a six (A6), he or she will hit, since adding the seven (7) would make the hand have less than seventeen (17).

If you are playing at a table that is not using this rule, then you should stand on any 17. This includes hands such as A6, A3, K8, etc. If the dealer has a ten (10) or an ace showing (A), he or she is likely to have a high card (HCP) total of 17 or 18. In this case, you would want to stand so that you can't lose more money if the dealer gets another card.

If the dealer has a two (2) through six (6) showing, he or she is likely to bust if he or she gets another card. In this case, you would want to hit your hand. A good rule of thumb is to hit if the dealers upcard is lower than your total and to stand if your total is higher than the dealers upcard.

#  Black Jack Dealer Hits on 17 in New Zealand - What does this mean for your game?

If you're a fan of the casino game Black Jack, you'll know that when the dealer hits on 17, it's not good news for your bank balance. But what does this rule actually mean, and what implications does it have for your game?

In Black Jack, the dealer must hit on 17. This means that they will always take another card in an attempt to reach a total of 21 or as close to it as possible. If they go over 21, they bust and lose the hand.

When the dealer is forced to hit on 17, it gives players an advantage. This is because there's a better chance of the dealer going over 21 and losing the hand. As a result, players can make more informed decisions about whether to stay in the game or not.

While some players may see the rule that forces dealers to hit on 17 as being unfair, it does provide more opportunities for them to win hands. So if you're looking to increase your chances of winning at Black Jack, make sure you factor in this rule when making your bets.
