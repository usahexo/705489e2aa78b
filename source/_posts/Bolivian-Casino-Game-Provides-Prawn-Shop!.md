#  Casino Game In Bolivia Providing Chance To Win Prawn Shop!

When in Bolivia, do as the Bolivians do – and that means playing the country’s national casino game, which offers the chance to win a prawn shop. Pesca, the name of the game, is like bingo, but with fish images in place of numbers on a board.
It may not be quite as well known as games such as blackjack or roulette, but pesca is gaining popularity all the time thanks to its unique blend of gambling and fishing. Not only does it offer players the chance to win big money prizes, but it also gives them the opportunity to test their angling skills too.

The origins of pesca are a little uncertain, but it is thought to have been invented in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, one of Bolivia’s largest cities. The game quickly spread throughout the country and can now be found in most casinos. The basic premise is very simple – players mark off fish images as they are called out by the croupier until they have five in a row and then shout “pesca!”. The first player to achieve this wins the game and any associated cash prize.

There are different variations of pesca, some of which involve betting on individual fish instead of simply marking them off as they are called. In some cases, players can also win extra prizes for catching certain types of fish. While this may add an extra level of complexity to the game, it doesn’t take away from its appeal – particularly for those who love spending time by the water fishing for trout or salmon.

If you’re looking for an interesting and unique casino game to try your hand at while in Bolivia, make sure you give pesca a go. Not only is it great fun, but there’s also a good chance you could walk away with a new prawn shop to call your own!
