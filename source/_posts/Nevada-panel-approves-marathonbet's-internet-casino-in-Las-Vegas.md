The Nevada Gaming Commission has given the green light to marathonbet's internet casino in Las Vegas. The gaming commission unanimously voted in favor of the new venture, which will see marathonbet become the first European-based company to offer online gambling services in the state of Nevada.

"We're excited to be approvals as the first European company to offer our innovative and exciting internet casino product in the great state of Nevada," said marathonbet CEO Andrew Cochrane. "This is a seminal moment for marathonbet as we continue our expansion into new and regulated markets."

In addition to its Las Vegas operation, marathonbet also has licenses to offer its internet casino products in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Michigan. The company currently offers a wide range of online casino games, including slots, blackjack and roulette.

"We are thrilled to be going live in Nevada," said Sacha Cheng, CEO of Marathonbet. "The Nevada market is one of the most important in the world for online casinos and we are committed to providing our players with the best possible experience."

To celebrate the launch of its new casino, Marathonbet is offering new players a 100% match bonus on their first deposit up to $1,000. In addition, players can take advantage of daily slot and table tournaments with prize pools worth thousands of dollars.

#  marathonbet to open internet casino in downtown Las Vegas

Marathonbet, a global online gaming company, announced that it will open an internet casino in downtown Las Vegas. The new facility, which is set to open in the fall of 2019, will be located at the intersection of Fremont and Main streets.

The casino will feature a variety of slots and table games, as well as a Sportsbook powered by Marathonbet’s world-class technology. It will also offer live dealer games, where players can interact with real dealers via streaming video feeds.

“Las Vegas is one of the most iconic gaming destinations in the world, and we are excited to be bringing our innovative internet casino to this city,” said Marathonbet CEO Joseph Asher. “We believe that our combination of exciting games and superior customer experience will be a big hit with players in Las Vegas.”

The new casino is part of Marathonbet’s broader strategy to grow its presence in the United States. In addition to the new Las Vegas facility, the company has plans to launch a sports betting website in New Jersey in the coming months.

Marathonbet has been operational online since 1998 and currently offers betting on over 25 different sports, including football (soccer), basketball, ice hockey, and American football. The company also offers a wide range of gaming products including slots, roulette, blackjack, and baccarat.

#  marathonbet expanding into internet casino market with new Las Vegas property

 Marathonbet, one of the world’s leading online sportsbooks, has announced that it is expanding into the internet casino market with the launch of a new Las Vegas property. The company has already secured a number of major gaming content providers for the site, including NetEnt, Aristocrat and Scientific Games.

Marathonbet CEO Jaan Tallinn said that the new casino would offer players an “unparalleled experience”, with top-quality games and promotions. He added that the site would also be available in a number of languages, including English, Russian and Chinese.

The new casino will be launched in September, in time for the start of the NFL season. It will offer a range of betting markets on both pre-match and in-play events, as well as a wide selection of slots and table games.

In a statement, Tallinn said: “This is an incredibly exciting development for Marathonbet. We have always been at the forefront of the online sports betting industry, and I am confident that our new internet casino will set the standard for others to follow.”

Marathonbet has been operating since 1997, making it one of the longest-running online gambling brands around. The company currently has licenses in Malta and Curacao, and is regulated by the UK Gambling Commission.

#  Race to open internet casino heats up as marathonbet moves ahead in Nevada

As the race to open the first internet casino in Nevada heats up, marathonbet has announced that it is moving ahead with its plans to open a new gambling site in the state.

The company says that it has already received approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission and that it expects to launch its new casino in early 2019.

This is likely to put marathonbet in a strong position to be the first operator to offer online gambling services in Nevada, although there are still a few other companies who are also planning to enter the market.

Marathonbet’s announcement comes as other major players in the casino industry are also making moves into the online space. MGM Resorts International has already launched an online casino in New Jersey, while Caesars Entertainment is also preparing to offer online gaming services in Pennsylvania.

There is growing demand for online gambling services as more states move towards legalisation. In Nevada, online gambling generated over $240 million in revenue in 2017, and this is expected to grow significantly over the next few years.

Marathonbet is well-positioned to take advantage of this growth, thanks to its experience in the online gambling market and its strong brand recognition. The company operates a number of popular online casinos and sports betting sites, and it is one of the largest bookmakers in Europe.

It will be interesting to see how the race to open the first internet casino in Nevada plays out, but marathonbet looks like it is well positioned to come out on top.
